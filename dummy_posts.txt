Compatible with Chuggington and Thomas & Friends train sets, this wooden activity table comes with a handy storage bin to collect all the bits and pieces after playtime is over — perfect for busy moms! Since the activity table is conveniently double-sided, kids can build their train sets on one side, and use the other side to color and play with arts and crafts. Easy to assemble, the 45-piece wooden train and activity table offers a great way to keep playtime centrally placed in one easy-to-clean location. The activity table with train set includes three trains, numerous buildings, trees, one police car and one ambulance. The train tracks are adjustable.",

The Camry currently has 169,000 miles. It has a clean title and has never been in an accident. The car has been well maintained as my grandmother had it regularly serviced at her local mechanic. I have the past two years worth of service records to show some of the work and maintenance that has been done. The car has also been serviced recently to ensure that it has no problems and is ready to sell. I have a copy of the carfax vehicle history report if you'd like to see it. The car has passed smog and I have the title in hand so it's ready to be sold. If you have any questions or would like to make an appointment to see the vehicle, please contact me at by call or text. If I do not answer, feel free to leave a message and I will get back to you. Thanks for looking.",
